For those having WiFi and camera-streamer issues with the Pi Zero 2W. 

---
WiFi issues:  
There are widespread ssh wifi lag issues with the Pi Zero. When you log into the pi all seems fine, then it hangs.  It takes serveral minutes to even list a directory.  

There seems to be lots of conflicting info online. I have confirmed they are not due to signal stregth.   They seem to be connected to power saving or having a diffrent time than your dns.
---
Camera-Streamer issues:  
No connection or just the first few frames.  Loss of connection after a few minutes. 

These seem to be linked to not having enough GPU memory allocated since the GPU is used in camera-streamer.

---***---***---***---

If you really want to avoid any headaches and have the added benifit of a wired connection and regualr usb ports, splurge and spend $65 on a Pi5. A Pi4 1 GB would be my minimum recomendations for a 3D printer with a webcam. 
x86 is the ultimate option for limitless power.

The Pi Zero 2W only has 2 micro USB ports. 1 for the MCU, one for the accelerometer or can and the Pi Ribbon cable is you have on the zero plus limited processing and GPU power for camera-streamer.  Cables must be made and power must be taken from the pins to save a USB connection.
Unless you need the space savings, a full size Pi is probably even more cost effective considering the added ports.
