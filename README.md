For those having WiFi and camera-streamer issues with the Pi Zero 2W. 

If you really want to avoid any headaches and have the added benifit of a wired connection and regualr usb ports, splurge and spend $65 on a Pi5. A Pi4 1 GB would be my minimum recomendations for a 3D printer with a webcam. 
x86 is the ultimate option for limitless power.

The Pi Zero 2W only has 2 micro USB ports. 1 for the MCU, one for the accelerometer or can and the Pi Ribbon cable is you have on the zero plus limited processing and GPU power for camera-streamer.  Cables must be made and power must be taken from the pins to save a USB connection.
Unless you want the space savings, a full size Pi is probably even more cost effective.
