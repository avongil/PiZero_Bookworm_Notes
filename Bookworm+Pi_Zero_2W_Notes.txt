To image the SD card, use the Raspberry Pi Imager to create an image with SSH enabled and a username and pass for your wifi network.

In order to get your pi camera to stream reliably and un-croped:

set gpu ram to at least 128 mb. *** works with 1640 x 1232, this is the minimum resolution with no cropping on the picam v2.1.  You can probably set gpu_mem to 192.  monitor free memory in the terminal with "free -m"  or in mainsail on the machine tab under system loads.
-
to set the gpu memory on boot up edit the config text file in /boot/firmware
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
--
[all]

gpu_mem=128

the crowsnest config looks like the text bellow. open the crowsnest log file visible in mainsail log area to find your device id. scroll to the end for the latest info!

Wifi issues:  setting your routers WiFi to another Chanel fixes the delay issue so you can use the terminal without that 10 min delay. It will fix it for 24  hours or so.    To keep this from happening, there seems to be a bug in bookwork that sets power saving to ON. As far as I can tell the pi does not have power saving.      setting wifi power to off seems to fix the issue.  It might also be related to an incorrect time.  Time servers are not set up in raspian bookworm for some reason.



checking if power saving is on:
terminal command:    journalctl | grep brcmfmac


Set wifi power off:
1: create a new service so it's persistent:

Terminal Command:    sudo systemctl --full --force edit wifi_powersave_off.service

in nano, enter this into the blank file and save:

[Unit]
Description=Set WiFi power save off
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/sbin/iw dev wlan0 set power_save off

[Install]
WantedBy=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device

------

2: enable the service:
terminal command:   sudo systemctl enable wifi_powersave_off.service

you must setup time server.
